- A Bug identified where the first over has seven balls instead of six if ball is set to zero, it can be partially be fixed by setting the ball to one, but the scoreboard by default will show 0.1 overs
- Design Updated
- This Over is functional but doesn't show the last ball score
- Added a new Start New Game to Reset the Scoreboard

- Slightly adjusted UI
